The key tasks are as follows:
1. Create a new migration project.
2. Add the on-prem database as source.
3. Run the database migration assessment.

## Success Criteria

* Created a database migration project.
* Data Migration Assistant showing there are no compatibility issues.

3. On the **Options** tab, ensure the **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** report types are selected, then select **Next**.

    ![The Options step is shown with Check database compatibility and Check feature parity options selected.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-options.png "Data Migration Assistant Options pane")

4. On the **Connect to a server** prompt, enter `localhost` for the **Server name**, and check the **Trust server certificate** option, then select **Connect**.

5. On the **Add sources** prompt, select the **WideWorldImporters** database, then select **Add**.

    ![The Add sources dialog box is shown with the WideWorldImporters database selected.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-add-sources.png "Add sources with WideWorldImporters database selected")

6. Select **Start Assessment** in the lower right.

    ![The Select sources step is shown with the WideWorldImporters database shown as previously selected and the Start Assessment button is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-start-assessment-button.png "Data Migration Assistant with the Start Assessment button highlighted")

7. On the **Review results** pane, you should see a message that states, "**There are no feature parity issues with your server instance.**"

    ![The Review results step is shown with the 'There are no feature parity issues with your server instance' message shown.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-no-feature-parity-issues.png "Data Migration Assistant showing there are no feature parity issues")

8. On the top left of the **Review results** pane, select **Compatibility issues**.

    ![The Compatibility issues option is selected on the Review results pane.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-no-compatibility-issues-selected.png "Compatibility issues selected")

9. On the **Review results** pane, you should see a message that "**There are no compatibility issues with your database**".

    ![The Review results pane is shown with Compatibility issues selected and showing the 'There are no compatibility issues with your database' message shown.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/ms-data-migration-assistant-assessment-no-compatibility-issues.png "Data Migration Assistant showing there are no compatibility issues")

10. The Data Migration Assessment is complete. If there were feature parity or compatibility issues found, then you would need to address those before migrating the SQL Server database to Azure SQL MI.
