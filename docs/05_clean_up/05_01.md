4. Select **Delete Resource group**.

    ![The Resource group pane in the Azure Portal for the resource group for this exercise is shown with the Delete resource group button highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-resource-group-delete-button.png "Resource group pane with Delete button highlighted")

5. Enter the name of the **Resource group** and select **Delete**.

    ![The confirmation box for deleting the resource group is shown with the resource group name entered into the 'Type the resource group name' field to confirm the delete operation and the Delete button is highlighted.](../../Hands-on%20lab/images/azure-portal-resource-group-delete-confirm.png "Delete Resource group confirmation prompt")

    Don't worry if the resources don't get immediately removed. Sometimes resources take a longer time to delete. Keep monitoring the process to make sure the Resource Group is fully deleted.

6. Disable Microsoft Defender for Servers (Arc), Storage and SQL as leaving this running can incur into added costs on your Azure Subscription.
